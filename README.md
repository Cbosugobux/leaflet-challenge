For this assignment, we were asked to create a visualization for earthquake data using Javascript.D3 and the Leaflet library in Javascript. 

The first thing students were asked to do was to visit the website of the US Geological Service. Using the GeoJson Feed that is offered through the website, students were able to get a url to a json 
of earthquake data. Students then were asked to create a map that plots the earthquakes from the given dataset based on their position on the planet using longitude and latitude.  Students were asked to make 
data markers that reflected the magnitude of each earthquake by its size and depth.  As the depth increased so did the darkness of the color used.

Additionally, using Leaflet's L.geojson, students were able to create hover markers that showed magnitude, depth, and location of each earthquake on the map.  

Lastly, students were asked to create a gradient on a legend on the visualization.  Using L.DomUtil, students were able to create div in the info.html code to put a legend which contained a color gradient for 
depth of each earthquake.
